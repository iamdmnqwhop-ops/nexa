# Publishing to Whop App Store

Congratulations on deploying your app! The final step is to publish it to the Whop App Store so other creators can install it.

## Prerequisites
*   **Deployed App**: Your app must be deployed (e.g., on Vercel) and running in production.
*   **Production URL**: You need your `https://...` URL.
*   **Permissions**: Ensure you have enabled the required permissions (`member:basic:read`, etc.) in the dashboard.

## Publishing Steps

1.  **Go to Developer Dashboard**
    *   Navigate to the [Whop Developer Dashboard](https://whop.com/dev/).
    *   Select your App.

2.  **Configure "Discover" Settings**
    *   Click on the **"Discover"** tab (or "App Store" settings) in the sidebar.
    *   **Listing Details**: Fill out the name, description, and upload your logo/screenshots.
    *   **Category**: Choose the category that best fits your app (e.g., "Productivity", "AI").
    *   **Pricing**: Set your app's pricing if you plan to charge creators for installing it (separate from the $14 user charge).

3.  **Submit for Review**
    *   Once all details are filled, the **"Publish to App Store"** button will become active.
    *   Click it to submit your app for review.

## Review Process
*   **Timeline**: Reviews typically take **2-7 days**.
*   **Requirements**: The Whop team will check if your app works as described and follows their guidelines.
*   **Trial Access**: If your app requires payment to test, provide a way for the reviewer to test it (e.g., a test card or a free access code).

## After Publishing
*   Once approved, your app will be listed in the Whop App Store!
*   You can share the direct link with community owners.
