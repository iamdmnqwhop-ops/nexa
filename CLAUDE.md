- always use frosted ui when working with component and also here is context for this project # 🧩 **PROJECT CONTEXT: NEXA**

## 💡 **Purpose**

We are building **NEXA**, an AI-driven system that turns ideas into finished, structured digital products instantly.
It’s built in the **Atlas-style** (inspired by helloatlas.io), meaning: abstract branding, dark minimal visuals, cinematic energy, and an infrastructure mindset — *not a simple AI app.*
We want Claude to act as a **co-creator, strategist, and product engineer** helping us plan, design, and build NEXA.

## ⚙️ **NEXA — Core Definition**

> **Tagline:** One idea. One click. One product.

NEXA eliminates the friction between having an idea and creating a digital product (guide, eBook, template, etc.).
It automates **synthesizing, structuring, and formatting**, delivering a **sellable final product** with minimal user input.
